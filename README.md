# DeLoaner - Decentralized commission based loan payback mechanism. [ 2nd prize winner @ DeFi the Conventional, UOttawa 2022]

Deloaner was envisioned to be a Point-Of-Sale attached commission based loan payback mechanism directed at small businesses in its initial venture.

### Case analysis for its ideal benefits

The basis of Deloaner is a commission-based loan payback mechanism, where until the borrower pays the amount, there is a commission applied to every transaction through a payment medium. 

Deloaner will provide a payment medium, which will eliminate the transaction fees, small business owners have to provide to credit card companies and other payment mediums while ensuring the process of loan payback is stringent.

A commission-based loan payback promises a loan retrieval of 90%+ because, in normal loans, every business starts with the hope to keep up with their loan payments, but there is always a chance of mismanagement of funds. Still, Deloaner removes the possibility of that by taking away the choice to allocate those funds to anything else, by taking the commission at the point of transaction. 

Another one of the great positives that Deloaner offers, is the inexistence of compound interest. Since all of the interest amounts are taken at every minuscule transaction, hence it does not compound in the long run, while ensuring that Deloaner still gets its pre-defined interest amount.

To explain how this would work, I will provide an example, Let’s say there’s a company called Sarah’s foods, which operates in a prime location, meaning that their cash flow is consistent. A consistent cash flow is all we need for a business to be eligible for our loan process.

Sarah requires a loan of 1000 CAD, and we offer to get that money if she pledges to pay back 1100 CAD, which looks like a 10% interest, but it is to be noted here, this is not an interest “rate”. 

After a revenue analysis, it turns out she generates revenue of 300 CAD a day. For the sake of an example, and because we can’t calculate how much each transaction is going to be, we take the interest amount out of this, while in the real-life case, it’s going to be on every transaction.
